    <div class="section">
      <h2>AI for Coral Reef Preservation</h2>
      <p>Scientists, including Steve Simpson from the University of Bristol, are leveraging AI and sound technology to monitor and preserve coral reefs. By analyzing audio clips from coral reefs, AI can identify species and assess reef conditions. This innovative approach, embodied in the SurfPerch AI model developed in partnership with DeepMind, is proving effective in areas like the Great Barrier Reef. The importance of these conservation efforts cannot be overstated, as coral reefs are vital to marine biodiversity.</p>
